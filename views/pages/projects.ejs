  <h1>My Recent Projects</h1>
  <h2 id="Gear">Spring-ASsist Folding Knife</h2>
  <img title=" A view of the suspension in action" src="/assets/images/projects/gear/gearPrelimSus.JPG" alt="A view of the suspension in action">

  <p>I designed and fabricated a spring assisted folding knife during my spare time while working at Zaber Technologies. The handles are made of steel and were CNC milled. The blade is A2 tool steel, and was profiled on a waterjet, ground, and heat treated to ~60 RC. </p>

  <img title="Closed Knife" src="/assets/images/projects/knife/black.jpg">

  <p>The knife is functional, but requires improvement. The locking mechanism is a bit of a compromise due to geometric constraints imposed by the opening system, and the handles are too soft and are worn to quickly by the pivot bearings. Both could have been improved if time allowed for another iteration</p>

  <h2 id="Bike">Road Bike Design (Work in progress)</h2>
  <img title=" A view of the frame itself" src="/assets/images/projects/bikedesign/bars_front_hq.JPG" alt="A view of the frame itself">

  <p>I am currently in the process of designing and modeling a modern aerodynamic road bike. The frame and cockpit (handlebars, stem, etc) have all been completely made from scratch, and have been designed to be compatible with modern components, as can be seen in the header and above.</p>

  <img title="A render of the frame by itself" src="/assets/images/projects/bikedesign/frame_hq.JPG" alt="A render of the frame by itself">

  <p>The frame itself has been optimized both aerodynamically and structurally through the use of SolidWorks CFD and FEA. the tubes are shaped such that they are both aerodynamic and appropriately wide to provide sufficient stiffness in the correct direction. For example, the seat tube is wide laterally to increase the overall resistance of the frame to lateral bending at the bottom bracket. The overall detail level of the frame is currently being increased such that the bike will eventually be complete and 'ridable'. </p>


  <h2 id="Gear">Landing Gear</h2>
  <img title=" A view of the suspension in action" src="/assets/images/projects/gear/gearPrelimSus.JPG" alt="A view of the suspension in action">

  <p>One of my many contributions to the WARG VTOL aircraft (and the only one showcased here, see my resume for more) was the development of a few conceptual landing gear systems. They varied in complexity. The first concept was retractable and suspended, as seen below.</p>

  <img title="Isometric View of the Gear" src="/assets/images/projects/gear/gearPrelim1.JPG" alt="Isometric View of the Gear">

  <p>The retraction mechanism is powered by one linear actuator, which is connected to the gear legs via a simple mechanical latching system. The actuator is in its minimum position when the gear are deployed to ensure that it does not fail when it is needed the most. The suspension is simple yet effective: It is capable of absorbing both horizontal and vertical impacts making landing on rough surfaces less of a hassle.</p>

  <img title="Non-Retractable Assembly" src="/assets/images/projects/gear/non.JPG" alt="Non-Retractable Assembly">

  <p>The second concept was  a non-retractable version, which was developed due to weight concerns, as seen above. However, time constraints were realized, and a new (much simpler) design was created that would be much easier to manufacture, as seen below. It uses material deformation to absorb impact as opposed to the gas springs seen in the above designs. This is the final design that has been fabricated. I </p>

 <h2 id="blimp">Hybrid Aircraft</h2>
  <img src="/assets/images/projects/blimp/mboh.jpg" alt="Shot of the craft in a flyable state">
  <p>The craft was developed with a small team with the intention of creating something that looked and floated like a blimp, but moved like an airplane. The design went through many phases (as can be seen in the difference between above and the header image), and many changes were made to accommodate for difficulties in construction. The craft was controlled by a custom micro-controller, and could be operated with the use of any Bluetooth compatible android device.</p>
  <img src="/assets/images/projects/blimp/plat.JPG" alt="What my design and analysis was focused on">
  <p>My main work was on the structural analysis of the central platform of the craft. I used conservative approximations to predict the deflection of the craft's supporting beams and ensure they were strong enough to resist the applied stress. Given that weight was a huge factor in the design of every part of the craft, I also had to design as efficiently as possible so it would fly in the end.</p>
  <h2 id="CAD">S.P.I.K.E Modeling</h2>
  <img title=" A render of the complete aircraft model" src="/assets/images/projects/spike/a.JPG" alt="A render of the complete aircraft model">

  <p>This accurate 3D model I created of WARG's current aircraft represents how advanced my SolidWorks skills are. It has been extremely useful to the team, and has been used in our ground station, simulator, to measure physical quantities of the craft (center of mass) and in making new parts to fit it like a glove (see gimbal). </p>

  <img title="A render showing the wing assembly" src="/assets/images/projects/spike/drone_wing3.JPG" alt="A render showing the wing assembly">

  <p>Each part of the aircraft was modeled in detail to reflect reality. The internals of the model line up well with the real-life plane, which allows us to use the model to figure out ideal component placement.</p>

  <h2 id="design">Everyday Design</h2>
  <img title="Laptop cooling chamber" src="/assets/images/projects/EverydayDesign/iso1.JPG" alt="A view of the suspension in action">

  <p>I am always looking for opportunities to make something that will make my life easier or more comfortable. I try to make everything I can as opposed to purchasing. The laptop cooling chamber I designed and fabricated shown above is a great example of this.</p>

  <img title="Bicycle bar holder - Threaded Stem" src="/assets/images/projects/EverydayDesign/stem.JPG" alt="Bicycle bar holder - Threaded Stem">

  <p>I use these small design projects as exercises in human centered design. I always look for ways to iteratively improve function or comfort. For example, the bicycle handlebar holder seen above, which serves to hold the bars straight while undergoing maintenance, has a chamfer around the bottom edge which causes it to pop off under load. It will be removed on a future version. Below you can see the ergonomic phone case I designed. It is the only project seen in this section that i have not been able to fabricate. This is largely due to the complexity of the shapes and the age of the 3D printers I have access to.</p>

  <h2 id="gimbal">Camera Gimbal</h2>
  <p>During the Unmanned Systems Canada competition that WARG participates in every year, QR codes must be read from altitudes in excess of 100 meters,  retrieving the contents of which being one of the main focuses of the competition. In late 2015/ early 2016, I lead a team in the development of a new camera stabilization system for use in the 2016 competition. </p>

  <img title=" Cutaway render of the camera gimbal" src="/assets/images/projects/gimbal/cutawaygimbalmount.JPG" alt="Cutaway render of the camera gimbal">

  <p>The gimbal has gone through many design/manufacturing iterations, with the latest being as aerodynamically optimized as possible given the constraints placed on it.</p>
